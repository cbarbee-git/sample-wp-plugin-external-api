# WordPress Plugin (External API)

This sample WordPress plugin gathers data from an external API call (New York Times). A list of recent best-selling books is returned.

## Description

The data returned from the API call is stored locally in a custom table to be used on the front-end. This ensures no API limits are met when making calls. It is assumed the data would not change very often. So, store data locally to be used without multiple calls.

Included in this repo is a custom WP layout that would be installed in the ROOT Directory of a WP theme to display the Best-selling books on a front-end page of your choosing.
